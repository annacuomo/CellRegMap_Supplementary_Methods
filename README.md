# Supplementary Methods for CellRegMap

Cellular Regulatory Map ([CellRegMap](https://github.com/limix/CellRegMap)) is a statistical framework for mapping context-specific regulatory variants using scRNA-seq, which doesn't require for cells to be discretized into groups.

This repo contains the Latex scripts to compile the Supplementary Methods available with the [CellRegMap preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.01.458524v1).
