# Supplementary Methods for CellRegMap

Cellular Regulatory Map ([CellRegMap](https://github.com/limix/CellRegMap)) is a statistical framework for mapping context-specific regulatory variants using scRNA-seq, which doesn't require for cells to be discretized into groups.

This repo contains the Latex scripts to compile the Appendix Supplementary Methods available with the [CellRegMap manuscript](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.202110663).
